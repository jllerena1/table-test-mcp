# Joke of the Day

**Why did the React component break up with the database?**

Because it couldn't handle the relationship! The component kept trying to fetch data, but the database was always querying for something else. They just couldn't sync up their states! 😄

**Update:** Good news! They're back together now! InstantDB helped them work things out with real-time sync. The component said "I can't live without you" and the database replied "I'll always be there for you, in real-time!" 💕
