# Joke of the Day

**Why did the React component break up with the database?**

Because it couldn't handle the relationship! The component kept trying to fetch data, but the database was always querying for something else. They just couldn't sync up their states! 😄

---

**Update:** Good news! They're back together now! InstantDB helped them work things out with real-time sync. The component said "I can't live without you" and the database replied "I'll always be there for you, in real-time!" 💕

**New Joke (January 15, 2025):**

Why did the developer update the README on a Wednesday?

Because documentation never sleeps! But seriously, keeping your README updated is like keeping your code clean - it makes everyone's life easier, including future you! 📚✨

*Remember: Good documentation is code that writes itself!*
