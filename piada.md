# Joke of the Day

**Why did the developer's app show a blank page?**

Because they commented out the schema and forgot to add an error boundary! 😅

The app was like: "I have nothing to say... literally NOTHING!" 

---

**After the fix:**

Developer: "Why is the page blank?"
App: "Because you told me to keep my schema to myself!"
Developer: *uncomments schema*
App: "NOW we can talk!" 💬✨

---

**Moral of the story**: Never ghost your schema in production! It needs to speak up!
