# Joke of the Day

**Why did the developer go broke after deploying to Vercel?**

Because they kept running out of serverless functions! 💸

(Get it? Because serverless isn't actually free-less!)

**Deployment Joke Bonus:**

Why do developers love Vercel so much?

Because it's the only place where pushing to production doesn't give them anxiety attacks! One push and you're live - no servers, no stress, just serverless success! 🚀
