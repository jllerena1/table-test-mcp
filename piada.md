# Joke of the Day

**Why did the developer's app show a blank page in production?**

Because `useAuth()` returned `undefined` and the code was like: "I don't know what to do with this... I'll just show nothing!" 😅

The developer: "Why isn't it working?"
The code: "I'm loading... wait, am I loading? I don't know! `loading` is undefined!"
The developer: *adds proper error handling*
The code: "Oh NOW I know what to do! Let me show you the login page!" 🎉

---

**The Sequel:**

Developer: "But why is it still blank?"
Console: "[InstantDB] ERROR: db.useAuth is not a function"
Developer: "Ah! I need to validate before using!"
Console: "[InstantDB] Successfully initialized with schema"
App: "Finally! I can breathe!" 💨

**Moral of the story**: Always validate your hooks and add logging! Your future self (and production users) will thank you!

**Dark Mode Edition:**

Developer: "The login page is too bright!"
User: "Can we make it darker?"
Developer: *adds dark mode toggle*
User: "Perfect! Now I can see in the dark!" 🌙
Developer: "Actually, it's darker by default now..."
User: "Even better! My eyes thank you!" 😎

---

**Moral of the story**: Dark mode isn't just a feature, it's a lifestyle! And always give users the choice! ☀️🌙

*Updated: January 15, 2025 - Added dark mode toggle with darker default background!*

**Grid Pattern Color Edition:**

Developer: "The grid pattern colors don't match the reference image!"
Designer: "The grid lines should be #ebebeb, not gray-500!"
Developer: "But gray-500/60 looks good..."
Designer: "Trust me, #ebebeb is the way to go!"
Developer: *changes colors to match exactly*
Designer: "Perfect! Now it's identical to the reference!" ✨
Developer: "And dark mode?"
Designer: "Just invert the logic - #3d3d3d for grid, #555555 for squares!"
Developer: "Got it! Colors are now pixel-perfect!" 🎨

**Moral of the story**: Always match the reference image exactly! Designers have eagle eyes! 👁️

*Updated: January 15, 2025 - Fixed grid pattern colors to match reference image exactly!*
